### Project Information
**Simple Map of Grinnell College Academic Buildings**: I thought it would be neat and simple to create a map of Grinnell College's academic buildings and hyperlink them to their respective websites.  This is a map created using the `leaflet` package in R.


### Citations
* The dataset used for this project was created by me.  I searched the latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates of each of the academic building and put them into a `.csv` file, which you can access in the repository.
* The Grinnell College logo used to create the custom markers was obtained from the following website: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bc/Grinnell_College_seal.svg/1200px-Grinnell_College_seal.svg.png
