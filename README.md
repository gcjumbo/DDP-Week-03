### Project Information
**Simple Presentation of Iowan Recidivism**: In the fall semester of 2017, I worked on predicting recidivism rate in Iowa for prisoners incorporated into a special program.  Understanding what prisoner traits are associated with rearrest after release (known as recidivism) is vital for the successful and effective implementation of assistance programs aimed at preventing recidivism.  Now, I am interested in creating a simple visualization based on that data.
